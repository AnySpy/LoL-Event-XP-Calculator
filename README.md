# LoL-Event-XP-Calculator
A small, terminal-based python program that allows you to estimate how many games you'll have to play in order to finish a challenge just using the "Time Spent Playing and Winning Games."

# How to download
Just download eventMath.exe and run it. It will open a terminal that prompts you questions.

# What can I do with this?
Apart from using the program, have fun. I provided the source code with eventMath.py. If you want to look at my silly goofy coding, go right ahead.

# Will this be maintained?
Yes. I'll edit it if Riot changes their numbers around or something like this. I'll also probably just optimize it over time.
